        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello World!

            My name is Rachel Boursia, and I am from and currently based in Seattle, Washington. Throughout my technical journey, I have achieved significant milestones that have shaped my expertise and passion for the tech industry. I began by completing The Year Up program, which laid a solid foundation for my professional growth. As a Technical Project Manager intern at Microsoft, I had the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience and contribute to meaningful projects. Additionally, my coursework with Generation USA in web development further honed my skills.

            <br><br>

            Currently, I am proud to be a part of The Multiverse Apprenticeship program, where I work as an associate software development engineer. Alongside this, I have pursued technical college courses and earned multiple certifications, enhancing my knowledge and demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Integrity, excellence, collaboration, and innovation are at the core of my values. I believe that upholding the highest standards of honesty, ethics, and transparency in every interaction is crucial to building trust and fostering meaningful relationships. Striving for excellence, I constantly challenge myself to exceed expectations and deliver exceptional results. I value teamwork, cooperation, and mutual respect, understanding that collective efforts lead to greater success. Embracing creativity and change, I continuously seek innovative solutions and approaches to problem-solving.
            
            <br><br>

            What sets me apart is not only my technical accomplishments but also my dedication to diversity and inclusion. As part of the 3% of Black women in the tech industry and the 8% of Black individuals in tech overall, I recognize the significance of representation and the need for diverse perspectives. I am passionate about sharing my journey to inspire others and promote diversity in all its forms. Additionally, my lifelong passion for gaming, spanning from video games to card games and board games, has nurtured essential skills such as problem-solving, adaptability, resilience, analytical thinking, and resource management. This gaming background fuels my enthusiasm for programming, as it allows me to apply my skills to modify servers and enhance my gaming experiences.
            
            <br><br>

            Creativity is at the heart of everything I do. In my personal time, I enjoy engaging in various creative activities such as karaoke, baking, and games. This passion extends to my professional life, where I find programming and software development to be limitless outlets for my creative ideas. I firmly believe that embracing creativity opens up a world of abundant opportunities and possibilities.
            
            <br><br>

            In addition to my technical expertise and commitment to diversity, I bring a strong work ethic and a growth mindset to my work. I am driven by a constant desire to learn and improve. By actively seeking new opportunities, I expand my knowledge and skills, keeping up with the latest industry trends and advancements.
            
            <br><br>

            Overall, my unique combination of technical skills, passion for diversity and inclusion, creativity, and strong work ethic sets me apart. I am excited about the continued growth and impact I can make in the tech industry, as I strive to contribute meaningfully and inspire others to pursue their passions within this field.
           
            <br><br>
